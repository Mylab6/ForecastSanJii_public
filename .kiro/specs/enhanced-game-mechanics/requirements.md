# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the San Jii Metro Emergency Weather Forecaster game to implement the complete decision-making gameplay mechanics described in the README.md. Currently, the project has a sophisticated radar visualization system (MapRadar.gd) with professional weather display capabilities, but lacks the interactive gameplay elements that would make it a complete emergency meteorologist training simulation. The existing GameUIHandler.gd provides a foundation for UI interactions, but the core game logic for timed decision-making, scoring, and scenario management needs to be implemented. The goal is to transform the existing radar display into a fully functional decision-making game where players must analyze weather patterns and make critical emergency management decisions under time pressure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player taking on the role of Chief Meteorologist, I want to face timed decision-making scenarios so that I can experience the pressure and responsibility of real emergency weather management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new game round begins THEN the system SHALL display a 90-second countdown timer
2. WHEN the timer reaches zero THEN the system SHALL automatically end the current round and evaluate the player's decisions
3. IF the player makes all required decisions before the timer expires THEN the system SHALL allow early round completion
4. WHEN a round is active THEN the system SHALL continuously update the radar display with evolving weather patterns
5. WHEN the timer shows less than 30 seconds remaining THEN the system SHALL provide visual urgency indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player analyzing weather threats, I want to identify which areas are currently threatened by severe weather so that I can make informed decisions about where to focus emergency responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presented with the impact assessment question THEN the system SHALL display all seven selectable areas (five cities plus Bahía Azul and Montaña-Long Ridge)
2. WHEN the player selects threatened areas THEN the system SHALL allow multiple selections from the available options
3. WHEN areas are selected THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing which areas have been chosen
4. IF no areas are selected THEN the system SHALL treat this as selecting "no areas threatened"
5. WHEN the player confirms their selection THEN the system SHALL store the impact assessment for scoring evaluation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player determining emergency response levels, I want to choose the appropriate action level for affected areas so that I can balance public safety with economic and social impacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the impact assessment is completed THEN the system SHALL present four response level options (NONE, WEATHER ADVISORY, SHELTER IN PLACE, EVACUATE NOW)
2. WHEN the player selects a response level THEN the system SHALL allow only one selection from the available options
3. IF the player selects EVACUATE NOW THEN the system SHALL display a prominent warning about career termination risks
4. WHEN EVACUATE NOW is selected THEN the system SHALL require additional confirmation before accepting the choice
5. WHEN the response level is confirmed THEN the system SHALL automatically determine if priority level selection is needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player setting emergency priorities, I want to assign appropriate urgency levels to my decisions so that emergency resources can be allocated effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF the response level is EVACUATE NOW THEN the system SHALL automatically assign HIGH PRIORITY without user input
2. IF the response level is SHELTER IN PLACE THEN the system SHALL present MEDIUM and HIGH priority options
3. IF the response level is WEATHER ADVISORY THEN the system SHALL present LOW and MEDIUM priority options
4. IF the response level is NONE THEN the system SHALL skip priority selection entirely
5. WHEN a priority level is selected THEN the system SHALL complete the decision-making process for the current round

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player receiving feedback on my performance, I want to understand the consequences of my decisions so that I can learn from mistakes and improve my meteorological judgment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a round is completed THEN the system SHALL evaluate all player decisions against the actual weather scenario
2. IF the player made a false evacuation call THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate the game with a "career ended" message
3. IF the player missed a major life-threatening event THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate the game with appropriate feedback
4. WHEN decisions are correct THEN the system SHALL provide positive feedback and advance to the next round
5. WHEN the game continues THEN the system SHALL update the player's performance metrics and professional rating

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player progressing through my meteorological career, I want to see my performance tracked and rated so that I can measure my improvement and advancement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the player at Trainee Meteorologist level
2. WHEN successful rounds are completed THEN the system SHALL increment the player's success counter
3. WHEN specific success thresholds are reached THEN the system SHALL promote the player to the next professional level
4. WHEN performance metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL display current accuracy rate, response time, lives saved, and economic impact
5. WHEN the player achieves Master Forecaster status THEN the system SHALL provide special recognition and unlock advanced scenarios

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player experiencing the game atmosphere, I want immersive audio feedback and voice acting so that I feel like I'm working in a real emergency weather center.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different game events occur THEN the system SHALL play appropriate audio cues (radio chatter, emergency tones, success/failure sounds)
2. WHEN critical decisions are being made THEN the system SHALL provide synthesized voice guidance in the style described in the README
3. WHEN the player makes evacuation calls THEN the system SHALL play voice confirmation requesting certainty
4. WHEN rounds are completed THEN the system SHALL provide audio feedback matching the decision outcome
5. WHEN background ambiance is needed THEN the system SHALL play appropriate weather service radio atmosphere

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player learning meteorology, I want to see authentic Doppler radar displays with realistic precipitation patterns so that I can develop skills interpreting real weather radar data like professional meteorologists.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather echoes are displayed THEN the system SHALL render precipitation using authentic Doppler radar visualization techniques with polygonal storm cells instead of simple circles
2. WHEN storm systems are shown THEN the system SHALL display realistic precipitation patterns including hook echoes, bow echoes, supercell structures, and mesocyclone signatures
3. WHEN different weather types are present THEN the system SHALL use authentic meteorological color scales (dBZ reflectivity values) with proper green-yellow-orange-red-purple intensity progression
4. WHEN displaying storm motion THEN the system SHALL show realistic storm cell movement, rotation, and evolution patterns that match actual Doppler radar behavior
5. WHEN severe weather features are present THEN the system SHALL include authentic radar signatures like velocity couplets, bounded weak echo regions, and three-body scatter spikes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a player learning meteorology, I want to encounter diverse and realistic weather scenarios so that I can develop skills handling different types of severe weather events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new rounds begin THEN the system SHALL randomly select from different weather scenario types (Hurricane Elena, CIUDADLONG Supercells, PUERTOSHAN Sea Breeze Storms, etc.)
2. WHEN weather scenarios are generated THEN the system SHALL create appropriate storm patterns matching the scenario type with authentic radar signatures
3. WHEN scenarios involve specific cities THEN the system SHALL position weather threats realistically based on geographic and meteorological factors
4. WHEN multiple scenario types are available THEN the system SHALL ensure variety across multiple rounds to prevent repetition
5. WHEN advanced players reach higher levels THEN the system SHALL introduce more complex multi-threat scenarios with realistic radar interpretation challenges
