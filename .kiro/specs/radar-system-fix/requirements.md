# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The San Jii Metro weather radar system needs to be fixed to provide a working, visually appealing radar display that shows weather patterns with a rotating sweep beam. The current system has multiple radar implementations that are not functioning properly, causing the radar display to appear broken or not render correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the weather game, I want to see a functional radar display with weather patterns, so that I can visualize storm systems and make weather-related decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the radar SHALL display a circular radar scope with range rings
2. WHEN the radar is active THEN it SHALL show a rotating sweep beam that continuously rotates
3. WHEN weather data is present THEN the radar SHALL display weather echoes with appropriate colors based on intensity
4. WHEN the sweep beam passes over weather echoes THEN they SHALL be visible and fade appropriately
5. IF no weather data is available THEN the radar SHALL still show the sweep beam and grid

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the radar to display realistic weather patterns, so that the simulation feels authentic and educational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather patterns are generated THEN they SHALL use realistic storm cell shapes and intensities
2. WHEN displaying weather echoes THEN the radar SHALL use standard meteorological color scales (green, yellow, orange, red)
3. WHEN storm systems are active THEN they SHALL show appropriate movement and evolution over time
4. IF severe weather is present THEN the radar SHALL display appropriate signatures like hook echoes or bow echoes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the radar interface to be clear and informative, so that I can understand the weather information being displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the radar is displayed THEN it SHALL show radar identification text (San Jii Metro Doppler)
2. WHEN the radar is active THEN it SHALL display current sweep angle and operational status
3. WHEN weather alerts are active THEN the radar SHALL show appropriate warning indicators
4. IF city locations are relevant THEN they SHALL be marked on the radar display

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the radar system to be performant and maintainable, so that it runs smoothly and can be easily modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the radar is running THEN it SHALL maintain smooth 60fps performance
2. WHEN rendering weather data THEN the system SHALL use efficient drawing methods
3. WHEN multiple radar types are available THEN the system SHALL use a single, working implementation
4. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade quality rather than freeze
